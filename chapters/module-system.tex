\chapter{The Racket Module and Macro Systems}
\label{chap:module-system}

Demodularization is made to run on a program written in a language that combines macros and modules.
For this research, we chose to implement demodularization for the Racket programming language because of its advanced macro and module systems.
This chapter gives background information on Racket through a detailed example program that demonstrates macro and module usage.

\section{The Racket Programming Language}
The Racket Programming Language is a platform for creating powerful abstractions.
These abstractions are created through the use of Racket's macro and module systems. 
The macro system, a heritage from LISP~\cite{LISP} and Scheme~\cite{scheme}, allows programmers to add new features to their programs in an integrated way.
The module system allows programmers to separate their programs into logical parts and hide implementation details. 
Together, they allow programmers to create Languages as Libraries~\cite{lal} that are suitable for specific tasks.

\section{Macros}
Macros are the main way programmers add new features to Racket. 
Macros are written alongside normal functions in a program, but they are used during the compilation of the program. 
Essentially, macros are functions (known as transformers) whose domain and range are syntax objects.
Syntax objects are data structures that contain the raw syntax of a program, along with lexical information and other properties associated with the syntax.
If a programmer needs the power, they can write transformers using all of the features of Racket, as long as the function takes in and produces syntax objects.
Racket provides pattern-matching for syntax objects that makes writing macros simpler when that is all that a programmer needs.

The \racket{define-syntax} form is used to identify a macro definition that is a function from syntax to syntax.
The helper function, \racket{syntax-case} matches syntax patterns so that it is easy to use them in the output of the macro.

  \label{lst:while-macro.rkt}
\end{listing}
Listing~\ref{lst:while-macro.rkt} shows how to write a macro that adds \racket{while} loop to the Racket language. 
The macro turns a \racket{while} loop into a recursive function and a call to that recursive function.
The \mintinline{racket}{#'} creates a syntax object out of the following parenthesized expression. 
The \racket{test} and \racket{body ...} forms are pattern variables that will be substituted by \racket{syntax-case} when a programmer uses the macro, with \racket{test} matching one expression and \racket{body ...} matching one or more expressions.
Listing~\ref{lst:while-expanded.rkt} shows a use of the while macro and what it expands into after running the macro. 
Whatever syntax is in the place of the pattern variables at the use of the macro will be put into the output of the macro.

% DONE: fuller explanation of hygeine with citation

Racket's macros are hygienic \cite{hygiene}, which means that identifiers created from programs will not clash with identifiers created from macros. 
This means that macros are protected from the surrounding program changing their identifiers, and also that the program is protected from the macro changing its identifiers.
In this example that means that the Racket program using a while loop macro will not be able to call the resulting \racket{while-loop} function that the macro creates, and that if the program happens to have another definition named \racket{while-loop}, that definition will be independent from the definition introduced by the macro.
Also, each use of the macro will have distinct definitions for \racket{while-loop} so that the macro can be nested and used multiple times.

\section{Modules}
% TODO: all listings are modules in separate files
Racket modules are a way of grouping definitions, expressions, and macros. 
Modules also allow control over imports and exports, using the Racket forms \racket{require} and \racket{provide} respectively.
Imports refer to other modules that have definitions for functionality that the importing module needs, and can specify the location of the other modules in multiple ways, from a simple filename to a package on the internet. 
Exports created by \racket{provide} list all of the identifiers within a module that will be visible by other modules when imported. 
By default, everything is hidden and a programmer must specify what becomes visible.

Listings~\ref{lst:counter.rkt}-\ref{lst:while-lang.rkt} form an example program that highlights the use of modules and macros together.
Figure~\ref{fig:modules.tex} shows the relationship between the different modules in the program.
\begin{figure}
  \input{figures/modules.tex}
  \caption{Module dependencies for the \racket{while-test} program}
  \label{fig:modules.tex}
\end{figure}
The main module of the program, \texttt{while-test.rkt} (Listing~\ref{lst:while-test.rkt}), uses a while loop (provided by \texttt{while-lang.rkt} in Listing~\ref{lst:while-lang.rkt}) and a counter (provided by \texttt{counter.rkt} in Listing~\ref{lst:counter.rkt}) to print out counter values.
The program also uses the \texttt{counter} module at compile-time to print out information about the \racket{while} loop (in this case, how many expressions are in the \racket{while} loop).

Listing~\ref{lst:counter.rkt} shows a simple Racket module and some of the features of the Racket module system.
\begin{listing}[tb]
  \inputminted{racket}{listings/counter.rkt}
  \caption{\texttt{counter.rkt}: A simple Racket module implementing a counter}
  \label{lst:counter.rkt}
\end{listing}
The \texttt{counter} module contains a variable definition and functions for getting and incrementing that variable.
The module only exports the functions, so the module encapsulates the variable.
If a programmer wanted to use this module, they would import it using \racket{require} as shown in Listing~\ref{lst:while-test.rkt}. 

\begin{listing}[tb]
  \inputminted{racket}{listings/while-test.rkt}
  \caption{\texttt{while-test.rkt}: A Racket module that uses other modules}
  \label{lst:while-test.rkt}
\end{listing}

It is also possible to use modules to help write macros.
For example, if a programmer wanted to change the \racket{while} macro so that it reported how many expressions were in each while loop, they could use functionality from the \texttt{counter} module inside the \racket{while} definition as seen in Listing~\ref{lst:while-lang.rkt}.
The definition for the \racket{while} loop is the same as in Listing~\ref{while-macro.rkt}, but now there is extra code that runs before the macro returns a syntax object.
The extra code uses the \texttt{counter} module to count how many expressions are in the body of the while loop and then prints that answer.
It is possible to add code to the \racket{while} macro because it is just a function from syntax to syntax that runs at compile-time. 

\begin{listing}[tb]
  \inputminted{racket}{listings/while-lang.rkt}
  \caption{\texttt{while-lang.rkt}: A Racket module implementing a language with \racket{while} loops}
  \label{lst:while-lang.rkt}
\end{listing}

Because the macro runs at compile-time and uses the \racket{counter} module at compile-time, the programmer must indicate that fact to the compiler.
This is done by using the \racket{for-syntax} form. 
The macro also uses \racket{printf}, which comes from the \texttt{racket/base} module, so that must be imported with \racket{for-syntax} as well.
Now this module can be used to extend the language of other programs by adding a \racket{while} loop, although it is just a library that is included like any other library.

\section{Languages}
% TODO: Rewrite this section, it sucks
The ability to use modules as languages allows programmers to write specialized domain-specific languages (DSLs) to better express solutions to domain problems. 
% TODO: akward sentence
Using this ability, programmers have added languages for Typed Racket~\cite{typed}, Object-Oriented Racket~\cite{oo}, Logic Programming~\cite{logic}, and more.
Also, because they are modules, it is possible to use them all in the same program and use the right language for each specific problem.
The language creating facilities of Racket extend to more than just collections of functions and macros; they also allow changing the parser and changing the meaning of things like function application syntax. 

\section{Phases}

The way the Racket module system allows for reliable separate compilation is by separating compilation and execution into phases.
Phase 0 is the execution phase of the main module of a program, what could be considered running the program.
Phase 1 is the compilation phase of the main module, which could include execution of code inside macros. 
A module can contain both phase 0 and phase 1 code; regular function definitions are phase 0, and macro definitions are phase 1.

Higher phases occur when macros use other macros in their implementation.
Another way higher phases occur is by importing modules for use inside a macro.
In the example program, the \racket{while-lang} module imports the \racket{counter} module using \racket{for-syntax}.
The \racket{for-syntax} form means that the module will be included for use at phase 1 relative to the including module, so that its code is available to use inside macro definitions.
There is an analogous form, \racket{for-template}, that will include code at phase -1 relative to the including module, so that the included module's code will be available for use inside the output of a macro. 
By allowing references to relative phases going in both directions, a Racket program can have a complex structure of imports and exports.

It is possible for a single module to be used in multiple phases, and each phase will have a separate instantiation of the module.
In the example program above, the \racket{counter} module will be instantiated twice, once for use while macros are running at phase 1, and once for use while the main program is running at phase 0.

Even though compilation of a program can go through many phases and interleave compiling and running code many times, side effects that occur during this process are discarded. 
The separate compilation guarantee of the Racket module system is that ``Any effects of the instantiation of the module's phase 1 due to compilation on the Racket runtime system are discarded'' \cite{sep}. 


\section{Compiling and Running Programs}

Compiling a Racket program interleaves traditional compiling (turning source code into bytecode) and running macros.
This process can then trigger compilation at higher phases if the macros use other modules in their implementation.
We will use compiling and running the example program in Listings~\ref{lst:counter.rkt}-\ref{lst:while-lang.rkt} to illustrate the process.

Compilation starts with the main module of the program, in this case \texttt{while-test.rkt}.
In terms of phases, compilation starts at phase 1.
Anytime the compiler encounters a \racket{require} form, it will switch to compiling the imported module, which would be \texttt{while-lang.rkt} in the example.
Compiling \texttt{while-lang.rkt} will trigger compilation of its imports as well, but this time its imports are required with \racket{for-syntax}.
This means that compilation switches to phase 2, and compiles the imports.
We can assume that \racket{racket/base} is already compiled, so the compiler moves on to compile \texttt{counter.rkt}. 
Because \texttt{counter.rkt} has no imports, it can be compiled completely into bytecode.
Now, the compiler can finish the macro in \texttt{while-lang.rkt} and produce bytecode for the macro. 
Next, the compiler switches back to phase 1 and continues compiling \texttt{while-test.rkt}.
The compiler runs into the import for \texttt{counter.rkt}, but it has already been compiled, so it moves on to compiling the body of the module.
The body contains a use of the \racket{while} macro, so it runs the code for macro, which includes printing out the number of expressions in the \racket{while} loop. 
Finally, the compiler turns the output of the macro into bytecode and finishes compilation.

To run the program, the Racket runtime loads the compiled bytecode for the \texttt{while-test} module and runs it, and when the runtime encounters imports, it runs them as well. 
With our example program, that means that nothing will happen on the import of \racket{while-lang} because it just contains a macro, and on the import of \racket{counter} the runtime will load the function definitions and create the \racket{x} variable.
This is a separate instantiation of the \texttt{counter} module than the one that was used at compile time, so the counter starts fresh from 0.



\section{Preparing for Demodularization}

Running a separately compiled Racket program involves following all of the \racket{require} forms and running all phase 0 code in the order in which the code is imported.
It is possible that there will be phase 0 code to run from an imported module where the import path to that module includes phase shifts.
Module phases are relative to one another, so if one module imports a module at phase 1, which then imports a different module at phase -1, the code in the third module will be at phase 0 relative to the first module and must be run in the final program.

By understanding how Racket programs are compiled and evaluated, it is apparent that only phase 0 code is necessary to run the program. 
This is the basis for how demodularization can recover whole programs from separately compiled Racket modules.
