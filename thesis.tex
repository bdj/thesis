\acknowledgments{%
I would like to thank Jay McCarthy for getting me interested in the field of programming languages, and for being both an advisor and mentor to me. I have enjoyed both our political and technical talks. Matthew Flatt has been an immense help in explaining to me the internals of the Racket runtime. He is always quick to respond to emails and offers salient solutions to problems I have had. I would also like to thank Eric Mercer, who took me on as his student after Jay left. I'm grateful for the opportunity he gave me to finish this thesis and the valuable input he gave in putting it together. Finally, I would like to thank my mom, Jane Johnson, for always believing in me and encouraging me to finish.
